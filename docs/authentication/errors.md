The log output contains several errors and warnings that indicate issues in the application startup and runtime. Below is a detailed breakdown of the errors and warnings, along with potential causes and suggested resolutions:

---

### Errors

1. **Missing ESCO Formatting Module**
   - **Log Entry**: 
     ```
     ERROR:app.services.esco_embedding_service384:Le module de formatage ESCO n'existe pas au chemin: /Users/philippebeliveau/Desktop/Notebook/Orientor_project/Orientor_Platform_Clean/backend/scripts/format_user_profile_esco_style.py
     ```
   - **Description**: The application is trying to load a formatting script for the ESCO embedding service, but the specified file (`format_user_profile_esco_style.py`) does not exist at the given path.
   - **Potential Cause**: The file is either missing, misplaced, or incorrectly named in the project directory.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Verify that the file `format_user_profile_esco_style.py` exists at the specified path: `/Users/philippebeliveau/Desktop/Notebook/Orientor_project/Orientor_Platform_Clean/backend/scripts/`.
     - If the file is missing, create or restore it. If it was renamed or moved, update the path in the configuration or code referencing this file.
     - Ensure the file has the correct permissions and is accessible by the application.

2. **GraphTraversalService Initialization Failure**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app.services.career_progression_service:Failed to initialize GraphTraversalService: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash (graph_traversal_service.py, line 557)
     ```
   - **Description**: The `GraphTraversalService` failed to initialize due to a syntax error in an f-string in the file `graph_traversal_service.py` at line 557. Python f-strings do not allow backslashes (`\`) within their expressions.
   - **Potential Cause**: An f-string in the code contains a backslash in its expression, which is invalid syntax. For example, something like `f"some\path"` within the `{}` of an f-string would cause this error.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Open the file `graph_traversal_service.py` and locate line 557.
     - Check for an f-string that includes a backslash in the expression (e.g., `f"{some_var\path}"`). Replace the backslash with a forward slash (`/`) if it’s a file path, or use a raw string or concatenation to handle the backslash correctly. For example:
       ```python
       # Incorrect
       some_var = "example"
       path = f"C:\{some_var}\test"  # Error: backslash in f-string expression
       
       # Correct
       path = f"C:/{some_var}/test"  # Use forward slash
       # OR
       path = fr"C:\{some_var}\test"  # Use raw string
       ```
     - Test the corrected code to ensure the service initializes successfully.

### Warnings

1. **Empty Career Recommendation Model File**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app.services.Swipe_career_recommendation_service:Career recommendation model file is empty: /Users/philippebeliveau/Desktop/Notebook/Orientor_project/Orientor_Platform_Clean/backend/app/models/career_recommender_model.pkl
     ```
   - **Description**: The career recommendation service attempted to load a model file (`career_recommender_model.pkl`), but the file is empty or corrupted.
   - **Potential Cause**: The model file was not properly generated, saved, or was corrupted, resulting in an empty file.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Check if the file `/Users/philippebeliveau/Desktop/Notebook/Orientor_project/Orientor_Platform_Clean/backend/app/models/career_recommender_model.pkl` exists and has content.
     - If the file is empty or missing, regenerate the model using the appropriate training script or process. Ensure the model training pipeline is correctly configured and executed.
     - Verify that the file path is correct in the application’s configuration.
     - If the model is not critical for development, consider adding a fallback mechanism or logging a more informative message to handle this gracefully.

2. **Anthropic Library Not Available**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app.services.socratic_chat_service:Anthropic library not available. Claude mode will be disabled.
     ```
   - **Description**: The application attempted to use the Anthropic library for the `socratic_chat_service`, but the library is not installed, so Claude mode is disabled.
   - **Potential Cause**: The `anthropic` Python package is not installed in the environment, or the service is configured to use Claude but the dependency is missing.
   - **Resolution**:
     - If Claude mode is required, install the Anthropic library using pip:
       ```bash
       pip install anthropic
       ```
     - Verify that the Anthropic API key is correctly configured in the environment variables if needed.
     - If Claude mode is not required, update the application configuration to disable or bypass this feature explicitly, or remove the dependency check to avoid the warning.
     - Ensure the application has a fallback mechanism (e.g., using another LLM like OpenAI) when the Anthropic library is unavailable.

3. **Development CORS Enabled**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app:⚠️ Development CORS enabled - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
     ```
   - **Description**: The application is running with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configured for development, which allows broad access to API endpoints. This is insecure for production environments.
   - **Potential Cause**: The application is explicitly configured to use permissive CORS settings for development purposes.
   - **Resolution**:
     - For development, this warning can be ignored if you are working in a local or test environment.
     - For production, update the CORS configuration to restrict origins to only trusted domains. In a FastAPI application, this is typically done in the middleware setup. For example:
       ```python
       from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

       app.add_middleware(
           CORSMiddleware,
           allow_origins=["https://your-production-domain.com"],  # Restrict to specific domains
           allow_credentials=True,
           allow_methods=["*"],
           allow_headers=["*"],
       )
       ```
     - Ensure the production environment has a different configuration file or environment variable to toggle stricter CORS settings.

4. **Default SECRET_KEY Used**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app:⚠️ Using default SECRET_KEY for development - change for production!
     ```
   - **Description**: The application is using a default `SECRET_KEY` for cryptographic operations (e.g., JWT signing), which is insecure for production.
   - **Potential Cause**: The application is configured with a hardcoded or default secret key for development purposes.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Generate a secure, random secret key for production. You can use a tool like Python’s `secrets` module:
       ```python
       import secrets
       print(secrets.token_hex(32))  # Generates a secure 64-character key
       ```
     - Store the key in an environment variable (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`) and update the application to load it from the environment:
       ```python
       import os
       SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", "your-default-development-key")
       ```
     - Ensure the production environment has a unique, secure `SECRET_KEY` set in the environment variables and never hardcoded in the codebase.

5. **No Holland Test Results Found**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     WARNING:app.routers.holland_test:No Holland test results found for user 85
     ```
   - **Description**: The application attempted to retrieve Holland (RIASEC) test results for user ID 85 but found none.
   - **Potential Cause**: The user has not completed the Holland test, or the results were not saved correctly in the database.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Verify if user 85 was expected to have Holland test results. If not, this warning may be expected behavior.
     - Check the database (table related to Holland test results, likely `user_skills` or a dedicated table) to ensure results are being saved correctly when the test is completed.
     - Add a fallback response in the API to handle cases where no results are found, such as returning an empty result set or a message indicating the user needs to take the test.
     - If this is a frequent issue, investigate the test-taking flow to ensure results are properly recorded.

6. **No Compatible Peers Found**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     INFO:app.routers.peers:No compatible peers found for user 85
     ```
   - **Description**: The peer-matching service could not find compatible peers for user 85.
   - **Potential Cause**: The user’s profile may lack sufficient data (e.g., skills, preferences) to match with other users, or the peer-matching algorithm is too restrictive.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Verify the user’s profile data in the database to ensure it contains enough information for matching (e.g., skills, interests, or Holland test results).
     - Review the peer-matching algorithm in the `peers_router` to check if the criteria are too strict or if there’s a bug in the matching logic.
     - Consider adding a fallback response to inform the user that no peers were found and suggest actions (e.g., completing their profile or taking the Holland test).
     - If this is a common issue, increase the pool of potential peers or relax the matching criteria.

### HTTP Errors

1. **403 Forbidden Errors**
   - **Log Entries**:
     ```
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63069 - "GET /api/v1/career-goals/active HTTP/1.1" 403 Forbidden
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63073 - "GET /api/v1/courses/ HTTP/1.1" 403 Forbidden
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63075 - "GET /api/v1/avatar/me HTTP/1.1" 403 Forbidden
     INFO:app.utils.database:HTTPException from endpoint: Not authenticated
     ```
   - **Description**: Multiple API endpoints returned a `403 Forbidden` status, indicating that the requests were not authenticated or the user lacked permission to access the resources.
   - **Potential Cause**:
     - The JWT token provided in the request is invalid, expired, or missing.
     - The user (ID 85) does not have the necessary permissions to access these endpoints.
     - The authentication middleware is rejecting requests due to misconfiguration.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Verify the JWT token used in the requests. Ensure it is valid and not expired by decoding it (e.g., using a tool like `jwt.io`) and checking the `exp` claim.
     - Check the authentication middleware (likely in `app.utils.clerk_auth`) to ensure it correctly validates tokens and extracts user information.
     - Confirm that user 85 has the appropriate permissions or role to access these endpoints. If role-based access control is used, check the user’s role in the database or Clerk’s user metadata.
     - Ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly formatted (e.g., `Bearer <token>`).
     - If the token is valid but the user lacks permission, update the endpoint logic to provide a more specific error message (e.g., “User does not have access to career goals”).

2. **404 Not Found Error**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63073 - "GET /user-progress/ HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
     ```
   - **Description**: The `/user-progress/` endpoint returned a `404 Not Found` status, indicating that the endpoint does not exist or is not correctly routed.
   - **Potential Cause**:
     - The endpoint `/user-progress/` is not defined in the `user_progress_router`.
     - There may be a typo in the route definition or a mismatch in the URL path.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Check the `user_progress_router` (as seen in the logs, it defines `/user-progress/` and `/user-progress/update`). Ensure the route for `GET /user-progress/` is correctly implemented.
     - Verify the route registration in the FastAPI app (logs show `/user-progress/` is registered with `GET`). If the implementation is missing, add the endpoint handler:
       ```python
       from fastapi import APIRouter
       router = APIRouter()

       @router.get("/user-progress/")
       async def get_user_progress():
           # Implement logic to return user progress
           return {"progress": "example"}
       ```
     - If the endpoint is not intended to exist, update the client-side code to use the correct endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/user-progress/`).

3. **307 Temporary Redirect**
   - **Log Entries**:
     ```
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63070 - "GET /api/v1/courses HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect
     INFO:     127.0.0.1:63075 - "GET /api/v1/courses HTTP/1.1" 307 Temporary Redirect
     ```
   - **Description**: Requests to `/api/v1/courses` are being redirected (HTTP 307), likely due to a trailing slash issue or a redirect rule in the application.
   - **Potential Cause**:
     - FastAPI automatically redirects requests to add or remove a trailing slash based on the route definition. The route is likely defined as `/api/v1/courses/` (with a trailing slash), so requests to `/api/v1/courses` are redirected to `/api/v1/courses/`.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Update the client-side code to use the correct URL (`/api/v1/courses/` with the trailing slash) to avoid the redirect.
     - Alternatively, configure FastAPI to disable automatic redirects by setting `redirect_slashes=False` when including the router:
       ```python
       app.include_router(courses_router, prefix="/api/v1", redirect_slashes=False)
       ```
     - Ensure consistency in route definitions (e.g., decide whether all routes should have trailing slashes or not).

### Other Observations

1. **GraphSage Model Loaded with Empty Graph**
   - **Log Entry**:
     ```
     INFO:app.services.graphsage_llm_integration:GraphSage model loaded successfully
     INFO:app.services.graphsage_llm_integration:Graph data loaded: 0 nodes, 0 edges
     ```
   - **Description**: The GraphSage model loaded successfully, but the graph data contains 0 nodes and 0 edges, indicating an empty graph.
   - **Potential Issue**: An empty graph suggests that the model may not function as expected, as it has no data to process.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Check the data loading process for the GraphSage model. Verify the data source (e.g., database, file) and ensure it contains valid graph data.
     - If the graph is intentionally empty (e.g., for testing), document this behavior to avoid confusion.
     - Add logging or error handling to warn if the graph is empty when it shouldn’t be.

2. **Successful Components with Potential Risks**
   - The application successfully loads many components (e.g., database, routers, authentication), but warnings like CORS and `SECRET_KEY` indicate potential security risks in production.
   - Ensure all warnings are addressed before deploying to production.

3. **Redundant Token Validation**
   - **Log Entries**:
     ```
     INFO:app.utils.clerk_auth:🔍 Token validation attempt
     INFO:app.utils.clerk_auth:✅ Token validated for user: user_30sroat707tAa5bGyk4EprB2Ja8
     ```
   - **Observation**: The same token is validated multiple times in quick succession (e.g., at 11:00:31.256, 11:00:31.265, etc.). This could indicate redundant requests or inefficient middleware logic.
   - **Resolution**:
     - Check the client-side code to ensure it’s not sending multiple simultaneous requests to authenticated endpoints.
     - Consider caching the token validation result (e.g., using an in-memory store like Redis) for a short period to reduce redundant validations.
     - Optimize the authentication middleware to avoid re-validating the same token multiple times within a single request cycle.
